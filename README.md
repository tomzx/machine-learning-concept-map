# Machine Learning Concept Map

The **Machine Learning Concept Map** is my attempt at reconstructing all the internal knowledge I've acquired about machine learning over the years.

The concept map can have multiple purposes:
* Serve as a refresher
* Find related topics of interest
* Guide newcomers in the domain by exploring topics by their relatedness
* Get an idea of the size of the domain

In order to keep the concept map simple, the **Machine Learning Concept Map** depends on the [**Mathematics Concept Map**](https://github.com/tomzx/mathematics-concept-map).

## Contributing

To view and explore this concept map, you will need a [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) compatible application. In order to edit this graph, I've personally been using [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

If you find any typographical mistake, improper links, or want to add more content to the concept map, feel free to submit a pull request!
